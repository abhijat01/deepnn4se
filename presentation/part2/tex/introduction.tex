\begin{frame}{Need for different kind of functions}
	\begin{block}{Discussed previously}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Simple, linear layers can be connected together to form deep networks.
			\item Linear layers should be separated using non-linear functions (layers) - also referred to as activations, e.g., $RelU(x)$, $\sigma(x)$ .
			\item Mathematically, learning is possible. In reality, people struggled to make 
			deep networks learn.
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Vanishing gradients
				\item Compute capacity 
				\item Availability of data 
			\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{New developments}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Activation functions  
		\item Regularization techniques (drop off, batch normalization) 
		\item Data (Google, Facebook,  $\dots$), standard datasets and competitions 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] Data collected by internet and social media companies, digital consumer 
			products like Cameras and Phones.  
			\item[-] Dataset and  benchmarks created by research labs and universities
				\footnote[frame]{See Russakovsky et al. 2015 for an example}  
			\item[-] Competitions and conferences organized around some of the datasets and 
			benchmarks  
		\end{itemize}
		\item CPUs, GPUs, nVidia
		\item {\it "New" functions}
